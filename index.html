    <p class="lead">
      Rural counties in New York, particularly those in the Adirondack and Catskill regions, have some of the highest food safety violation rates in the state, far outpacing the rates in many urban and suburban counties. An analysis of more than 20,000 inspection records reveals a sharp geographic divide, in which sparsely populated, tourism-driven areas accumulate far more violations per capita than New York’s largest counties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Essex County leads the state with 2,167.6 violations per 100,000 residents. Hamilton County, the least populous county in New York, follows with 2,041.7. Warren County ranks third with 2,021.4, and Cortland and Greene Counties round out the top five, at 1,693.6 and 1,679.2 respectively. All five are rural or heavily dependent on seasonal tourism, a pattern that distinguishes them from counties with larger populations and more robust health departments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, large counties across the state have much lower violation rates. Orange County reports the lowest rate statewide at 130.9 violations per 100,000 residents. Nassau County, with a population of 1.3 million, logs just 282 per 100,000 people, and Oneida County records 183. The discrepancies between these counties point to infrastructure differences: dense, well-funded health departments can conduct more routine oversight, while rural counties often operate with minimal staff and vast geographic territories.

      “Inspectors look at a variety of things, including cleanliness, food temperatures, and how items are stored,” said the owner of Laci’s Tapas Bar in Syracuse. “We use posted reminders on our freezers and refrigerators showing what can be stored above or below other items, and we clean the kitchen and floors every night at closing. We also have ongoing pest control to prevent issues.”

    <p>
      The rural surge in violations can be traced to several structural challenges. Restaurants in mountain and lake regions rely heavily on temporary seasonal workers, often bringing in new staff each spring or summer. Compressed onboarding timelines and inconsistent training environments contribute to lapses in sanitation, temperature control, equipment maintenance, and other core food safety practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dataset supports this interpretation. Rural counties show exceptionally high total violations but moderate repeat-offender rates, suggesting these issues stem from capacity constraints rather than chronic disregard for safety. In many cases, a single inspector may oversee a region larger than several downstate counties combined, delaying follow-up visits and allowing minor problems to grow into long lists of recorded violations.

    <h2 class="section-head">What the Data Shows</h2>

    <p>
      The counties with the highest per-capita violations, Essex, Hamilton, Warren, Cortland, and Greene, form a cluster across rural upstate New York, particularly in tourism-driven regions. Their per-capita violation rates exceed 1,600 violations per 100,000 residents, towering over counties with far larger populations.
